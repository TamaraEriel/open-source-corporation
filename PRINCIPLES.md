# Principles

This is an early draft. it's just notes and not actionable yet.
  * _The Empowerment Principle_ - Empower people with knowledge of high level goals, and the ability to make progress towards those goals. This includes lending your ear to remove roadblocks.
  * _The Collaboration Principle_ - Collaborate with clients to exceed (ideally by orders of magniutude) a 300% ROI on the client's investment in our billables.
  * _The Disruption Principle_ - Do work that excites us and has a chance to affect change in its' industry.
  * _The Direction Principle_ - Collaborate to keep and updated list of specific opportunities shared with our team.
  * _The Transparency Principle_ - Share everything in the most public place that doesn't endanger someone's privacy or property.
  * _The Systems Principle_ - Continuously work on improving our processes to create a productive work environment.
  * _The Clarity Principle_ - Strive to achieve *clarity* in all that we do. The founder (Clark Van Oyen) believes a lack of clarity (ambiguity, uncertainty and lack of the right communication) to be the number one cause of failure in software projects overall.
  * _The Value Principle_ - maximize total value creation. Our everyday activities should result in additional content/value shared online.
  * _The Consistency Principle_ - Avoid arbitrary inconsistency.

Embrace a culture of consistency early on, when the team is small.
Clearly set expectations around how that culture is to be maintained, including the extraction of internal tooling.
Dedicate engineers to this problem only when needed, and make sure those engineers deeply understand iterative development and can actively seek feedback.
