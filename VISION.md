# Vision Statement

Codify the many-faceted problem of web technology delivery, so it can be abstracted away and simplified to allow everyone to better focus on their customers. This should be done in a way that caters to the situation of a business implementing the technology.

## Back story

From Clark Van Oyen, Founder at Countable Web Productions.

### Web Technology Is Still A Dark Art

Over the last decade my journey has involved bringing web technology to many businesses for a variety of reasons:

  * Web Based Startups - Bring core web technology products to profitability or the next round of funding via prototyping.
  * Automation - business process automation and the requisite monitoring.
  * Cloudify Existing Products - Many typically physical/non-web products now a companion "cloud" elements such as an API, web UI, etc.

This has resulted in a lot of learning. Web technology is largely a craft and dark art with unique challenges. The best approach for success
has largely been to hire the smartest developers with a base level of experience, communicate your objectives, and
have these people manage their own work and all aspects of the project. Developers with this capability are increasingly
rare and the competition for their time is fierce. Even if you do land the right person, they're likely to still miss some 
key aspect such as:

  * Understanding business priorities and effectively encoding them in the nuances of the code and the software development process.
  * Properly mentoring others to fill their role later
  * Using techniques, platform, tools and architecture that others can understand and later take over.
  * Having a basic knowledge of security, privacy, copyright law of libraries, and other subtleties.
  * How to approach Testing, Deployment and Operational pipelines.

### Finding Good Developers is Hard

Keeping them around, transitioning their knowledge, and aligning their work with product-market fit is harder.

Now, assume we strike gold and find a team who can build your technology, and does all these things, and you can retain them.
Wouldn't it still be much better if these amazing people could focus on the opportunities and technology strategy of your business instead of all these minutiae?

For most cases, you're lucky enough to get a developer who can even implement [fiz-buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) in order to contribute to your product at all, in a world of recruiters who have no idea how to determine developer capability. Let alone understanding a huge fast moving ecosystem and riding all the right waves.

### The Vision

What if we could codify web development over time to continuously spend more time on the "good" stuff, focusing on your customers and opportunities? What if you could have just a little access to all the right deep domain knowledge in the context of your business? And, what if we could do all the basic things right by default without needing a team of amazing specialists.

This is the core idea behind Countable Consulting. To develop the processes and tools to abstract away the multifaceted problem of building a web technology team.
